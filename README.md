### Video

This video shows you how to complete the lesson task 3.2. Only watch it after attempting the lesson task by yourself.

Please note: To get Flexbox working correctly with images, please place the images in a figure (or div). The video will be updated shortly to show this. For example,
```html
<section class="flex-container">
  <figure class="flex-item">
    <img src="images/image1.jpg" alt="Info about the image">
  </figure>
  <figure class="flex-item">
    <img src="images/image2.jpg" alt="Info about the image">
  </figure>
  <figure class="flex-item">
    <img src="images/image3.jpg" alt="Info about the image">
  </figure>
</section>
```

Please do not view this video unless you've read the above. You have to place the images in a div/figure element. The video does not show this part of the process [View on Vimeo](https://vimeo.com/481248782/d58599b3e7)
